  <p><b> Hello World!</b></p>
  <p><b> Welcome to my experimental webpage (via HTML) for the first coding class ever!</b></p> 
  <p> Today I am trying out something called CSS, hopefully this will work out.</P>
  <P>I never realized how cumbersome PCs can get in contrast to MACs when it comes to programming.</P>
  <p>However when it comes to basic internet usage as well as the basics of using a computer PCs tends to be a little more simple.</p>
  <p> As of this week <b>9/19/2016</b> we began to learn JavaScript, which to many was considered to be real programming, and that all the other stuff prior is the equivilant of those training wheels on bikes.</p>

<p>As of <b>Week 3 (9/26-9/30)</b> we continued to learn on how to write functions on JavaScript.  So far it's been quite a challenge I would say.  But I'm doing the best I can and that's what I can only do.</p>

<p>As of <b>Week 4 (10/3-10/7)</b> we continued the process of learning JavaScript.  Just a few days ago we as a class began to learn a new section of JavaScript with Loops and Arrays.  While there were a few differences between that and regular functions, both remained just as hard to do as the process was quite challenging.  But like I said I continue to try to do the best I can.</p>

<p> Also during that same week <b>(10/3-10/7)</b>, we as a class made a visit to Advent Software in Downtown San Francisco.  Advent Software is a company that creates software programs for the finance industry to use in management areas like stocks, portfolios, trading, investment and so forth etc.  From there we did mock interviews with employees who worked at Advent.  A variety of questions were asked that would be asked in a typical job interview (I got to admit I was a little nervous).  After that I got some essential feedback to help improve what I needed to improve.  After that we did a brief session where we got to ask the employees about their background and how they got to where they are now.  After that we got to take and exclusive tour of the company's security and network infrastructure and where all the "magic" happens.  Boy it was one hell of a tour being able to see all of the operations and how almost no one but two people have unsupervised access in the control room.  We saw the modern equipment, and a few dinosaurs they keep for longtime customers.  In the end it was a great unique experience that I myself very much enjoyed.</p>
