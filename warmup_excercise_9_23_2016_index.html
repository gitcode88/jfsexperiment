      document.getElementById('count').textContent = totalToDisplay;

      // First we need a pointer or label for the elements we're adding the click handlers to.

      // Let's start by adding variable labels or pointers to the add button

      var addButton = document.getElementById('add');

      // Next we can add an event listener. The event we'll listen for is a click event.

      addButton.addEventListener('click', function() {

        // So this is weird. We're passing a function to a function as an arugment!

        // If it's making your brain hurt, that's fine. We'll talk about this again together

        // Probably the week after next.

        // So what do we do inside of this function?

        // We want to add one to the variable totalToDisplay

        // and then we want to update the DOM (the view in the browser)

        // well, we can add one using one of three methods

        /*

          we can say totalToDisplay = totalToDisplay + 1; (reassign the variable itself plus one)

          or we can say totalToDisplay += 1 (Short hand for the above, does the same thing)

          ** Note that the above two operators work for any mathmatical operation. -=, /=, *=, even %= !

          or we can say totalToDisplay++; (The ultimate shorthand for plus one. It also works for -- as in minus one. But not the other operators! Like there is no ** or // )

        */

        // So, let's do it! Add one to the totalToDisplay variable

        // The Computer Science-y way to say add one is increment

        totalToDisplay += 1;

        // Lastly, we update the DOM.

        document.getElementById('count').textContent = totalToDisplay;

        // And that's it! A lot of comments, but not a lot of code at all!

      });

      function subtract() {

        // first we decrement totalToDisplay (decrement means subtract one in CS speak.)

        totalToDisplay--;

       * These extra stars aren't necessary, they just look cool

       * This example may be a bit overly complex.

        displayDiv.textContent = displayName;

        // lastly we clear the input element's value

        userInputField.value = '';

      }

      // Next we can add our event listeners.

      // First our "submit" button will call greetUser when it's pressed

      submitButton.addEventListener('click', greetUser);

      // Next we can add an event listener to the acutal input element that checks for a key press event

      userInputField.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {

        // console.log(event); // Uncomment this line to check out what the event object looks like!

        // We'll talk about objects next week. Another data structure.

        // first, we check to see if they pressed enter by using the keycode

        if (event.which === 13) { // which represents which key. The keycode for enter is 13

          // If it was, we call our greetUser function. Otherwise we do nothing.
